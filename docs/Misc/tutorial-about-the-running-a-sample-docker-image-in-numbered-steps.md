# Tutorial: Running a Sample Docker Image

In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of running a sample Docker image. Docker allows you to package an application and its dependencies into a standardized unit called a container, which can be easily deployed and run on any platform.

Follow the numbered steps below to get started:

1. **Install Docker**: Before you can run a Docker image, ensure Docker is installed on your system. Visit the [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Pull the Docker Image**: Docker images are hosted in repositories, and you need to pull the desired image to your local system. Open a terminal or command prompt and enter the following command:
   ```
   docker pull IMAGE_NAME
   ```
   Replace `IMAGE_NAME` with the name of the Docker image you want to use. This command will download the image from the repository.

3. **Verify Image Pull**: To verify that the image has been successfully pulled, use the following command:
   ```
   docker images
   ```
   You should see the pulled image listed among the available images.

4. **Run the Docker Image**: Now it's time to run the Docker image as a container. Execute the following command:
   ```
   docker run IMAGE_NAME
   ```
   Replace `IMAGE_NAME` with the name of the image you pulled in the previous step. Docker will create a new container based on this image.

5. **Access Container Output**: If the containerized application produces any output, you can access it using the Docker logs. Run the following command to view the logs:
   ```
   docker logs CONTAINER_ID
   ```
   Replace `CONTAINER_ID` with the ID of the running container, which you can find using the command `docker ps`.

6. **Interact with the Container**: Sometimes, you may need to interact with the running container, such as executing commands or modifying files. Use the following command to access the container's shell:
   ```
   docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID bash
   ```
   This will open a shell inside the running container, allowing you to execute commands as if you were on the host system.

7. **Stop the Container**: Once you are done with the container, you can stop it using the command:
   ```
   docker stop CONTAINER_ID
   ```
   Replace `CONTAINER_ID` with the ID of the running container.

8. **Remove the Container**: If you no longer need the container, you can remove it using the following command:
   ```
   docker rm CONTAINER_ID
   ```
   Remember to replace `CONTAINER_ID` with the ID of the container you want to remove.

9. **Remove the Docker Image**: If you no longer need the Docker image, you can remove it from your system using the command:
   ```
   docker rmi IMAGE_NAME
   ```
   Replace `IMAGE_NAME` with the name of the image you want to remove.

That's it! You have successfully run a sample Docker image as a container. Docker provides a powerful and flexible platform for deploying and managing applications. Explore further by experimenting with other Docker images and building your own containers.
