# Deploying API Gateways (Kong, Tyk) Using Ansible

In this document, we will explore how to deploy API gateways, specifically Kong and Tyk, using Ansible. We will go through a step-by-step guide to help you set up and configure the API gateways in your environment. Ansible is an open-source automation tool that allows you to automate the deployment and management of software applications.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. An environment with Ansible installed.
2. A target infrastructure where you want to deploy the API gateways (Kong and Tyk).
3. Basic knowledge of Ansible playbooks and inventory management.

## Step 1: Setting up the Ansible Inventory

The Ansible inventory is a file that contains information about the hosts and groups (collections of hosts) in your infrastructure. Let's start by creating an inventory file called "hosts.ini" and add the following content:

```ini
[kong]
kong-host-1 ansible_host=<kong-host-1-ip>

[tyk]
tyk-host-1 ansible_host=<tyk-host-1-ip>
```

Replace `<kong-host-1-ip>` and `<tyk-host-1-ip>` with the actual IP addresses of your Kong and Tyk hosts.

## Step 2: Creating Ansible Playbooks

Ansible uses playbooks to define the desired state of your infrastructure. We will create two playbooks, one for Kong and another one for Tyk.

### Deploying Kong

Create a playbook called "kong.yml" and add the following content:

```yaml
---
- name: Install Kong
  hosts: kong
  become: true

  tasks:
    - name: Add Kong repository key
      apt_key:
        url: https://deb.konghq.com/key.asc
        state: present

    - name: Add Kong repository
      apt_repository:
        repo: deb https://deb.konghq.com/ubuntu stable main
        state: present

    - name: Install Kong
      apt:
        name: kong
        state: present

    - name: Configure Kong
      template:
        src: kong.conf.j2
        dest: /etc/kong/kong.conf

    - name: Start Kong
      service:
        name: kong
        state: started
        enabled: true
```

### Deploying Tyk

Create a playbook called "tyk.yml" and add the following content:

```yaml
---
- name: Install Tyk
  hosts: tyk
  become: true

  tasks:
    - name: Add Tyk repository key
      apt_key:
        url: https://packagecloud.io/gpg.key
        state: present

    - name: Add Tyk repository
      apt_repository:
        repo: deb https://packagecloud.io/tyk/tyk-gateway/ubuntu/ bionic main
        state: present

    - name: Install Tyk
      apt:
        name: tyk-gateway
        state: present

    - name: Configure Tyk
      template:
        src: tyk.conf.j2
        dest: /opt/tyk-gateway/tyk.conf

    - name: Start Tyk
      command: /opt/tyk-gateway/install/setup.sh --dashboard=1 --version="v3"
```

## Step 3: Configuring the API Gateway

Both Kong and Tyk require configuration files to set up the API gateway. We will use Jinja2 templates to generate the configuration files dynamically.

### Kong Configuration

Create a file called "kong.conf.j2" and add the following content:

```jinja2
prefix = /usr/local/kong
log_level = notice
```

### Tyk Configuration

Create a file called "tyk.conf.j2" and add the following content:

```jinja2
app_path = "/opt/tyk-gateway"
```

You can customize these configuration files as per your requirements.

## Step 4: Running the Ansible Playbooks

Now that we have created the playbooks and configuration files, it's time to run them using Ansible. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you have all the files.

To deploy Kong, run the following command:

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini kong.yml
```

To deploy Tyk, run the following command:

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini tyk.yml
```

Ansible will connect to the respective hosts and execute the tasks defined in the playbooks, installing and configuring the API gateways.

## Conclusion

In this document, you learned how to use Ansible to deploy API gateways such as Kong and Tyk. We covered the steps from setting up the Ansible inventory to creating playbooks and configuring the gateways. Ansible simplifies the deployment process and allows for easily managing multiple hosts and configurations. With this knowledge, you can efficiently deploy and manage API gateways in your infrastructure.
