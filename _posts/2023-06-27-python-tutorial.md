# Python Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will cover the basics of Python programming language. Python is a versatile and powerful language known for its simplicity and readability. Whether you are a beginner or have experience with other programming languages, this tutorial will help you get started with Python.

## 1. Installation <a name="installation"></a>

To get started with Python, you need to install it on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website at [python.org](https://www.python.org). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

## 2. Running Python <a name="running-python"></a>

Once Python is installed, you can run Python scripts in different ways:
- **Interactive Mode**: Open a terminal or command prompt and type `python`. This opens the Python interpreter, where you can type and execute Python code line by line.
- **Script Mode**: Write your Python code in a file with a `.py` extension, such as `script.py`. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the script is saved, and type `python script.py` to run the script.

## 3. Variables and Data Types <a name="variables-and-data-types"></a>

In Python, you can assign values to variables using the assignment operator (`=`). Python supports various data types, including:

- **Numeric Types**: `int`, `float`, `complex`
- **Boolean Type**: `bool`
- **Sequence Types**: `str`, `list`, `tuple`
- **Mapping Type**: `dict`
- **Set Types**: `set`, `frozenset`

Here's an example of assigning values to variables:

```python
# Assigning values to variables
name = "John Doe"
age = 25
height = 1.75
is_student = True
```

## 4. Operators <a name="operators"></a>

Python provides a variety of operators to perform operations on variables and values. These include:

- **Arithmetic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`, `//`
- **Comparison Operators**: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
- **Assignment Operators**: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `**=`, `//=`
- **Logical Operators**: `and`, `or`, `not`
- **Bitwise Operators**: `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`

```python
# Arithmetic Operators
x = 10
y = 3
addition = x + y
subtraction = x - y
multiplication = x * y
division = x / y
modulus = x % y
exponentiation = x ** y
floor_division = x // y

# Comparison Operators
is_equal = x == y
is_not_equal = x != y
is_greater = x > y
is_less = x < y
is_greater_equal = x >= y
is_less_equal = x <=

# Logical Operators
logical_and = (x > 0) and (y < 5)
logical_or = (x > 0) or (y < 5)
logical_not = not (x > 

0)

# Bitwise Operators
bitwise_and = x & y
bitwise_or = x | y
bitwise_xor = x ^ y
bitwise_not = ~x
left_shift = x << y
right_shift = x >> y
```

## 5. Control Flow <a name="control-flow"></a>

Python provides several control flow statements to control the execution of code blocks. These include:

- **Conditional Statements**: `if`, `elif`, `else`
- **Looping Statements**: `for`, `while`
- **Control Statements**: `break`, `continue`, `pass`

Here's an example of an if-else statement and a for loop:

```python
# Conditional Statements
age = 20

if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote.")

# Looping Statements
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for num in numbers:
    if num == 3:
        continue  # Skip the rest of the code in this iteration
    print(num)

```

## 6. Functions <a name="functions"></a>

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They allow you to organize your code and avoid repetition. You can define your own functions in Python using the `def` keyword.

Here's an example of a function that calculates the square of a number:

```python
def square(number):
    """Return the square of a number."""
    return number ** 2

result = square(5)
print(result)  # Output: 25
```

## 7. Modules and Packages <a name="modules-and-packages"></a>

Python allows you to use existing code from other files by importing modules or packages. Modules are single files, while packages are directories with multiple modules. You can import them using the `import` keyword.

```python
# Importing modules
import math

result = math.sqrt(16)
print(result)  # Output: 4.0

# Importing specific functions from a module
from math import sqrt, pi

result = sqrt(25)
print(result)  # Output: 5.0

print(pi)  # Output: 3.141592653589793
```

## 8. File Handling <a name="file-handling"></a>

Python provides built-in functions for file handling operations, such as reading from and writing to files. You can open files using the `open()` function and specify the file mode (e.g., read mode, write mode).

```python
# File Handling
# Reading from a file
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

# Writing to a file
with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!")
```

This concludes our basic Python tutorial. Python offers much more functionality and features, but this tutorial should give you a solid foundation to start exploring further. Happy coding!
